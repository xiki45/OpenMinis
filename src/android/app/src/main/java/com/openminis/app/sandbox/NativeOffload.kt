     * `<rootfs>/tmp/.native-offload-<pid>-<seq>` and returns the GUEST path;
     * proot's native_offload extension then rewrites the tracee's execve into
     * `/bin/cat <tmpfile>`. So the host cannot delete the file at reply time —
     * `cat` has not run yet, and deleting it would turn every offload call into
     * "No such file or directory". Nothing else ever removed them either
     * (`delete`/`cleanup` were zero occurrences in this file), so one file
     * accumulated per offload call, forever: measured on a dev device, 35 files
     * spanning 12 days and surviving many app restarts, growing +1 per call.
     * On a heavy user's device this reached thousands of files / GBs, showing
     * up as an inflated "Shell container" figure on the storage screen.
     *
     * WHY DELETING IS SAFE HERE.
     *  - [all] = true is used at server start. Any file present then belongs to
     *    a PREVIOUS app process: its tracee died with that process, so no `cat`
     *    can still be pending on it.
     *  - [all] = false keeps files younger than [REPLY_TTL_MS] and is used
     *    opportunistically while serving. The TTL is what makes it safe: it only
     *    ever removes files far older than the microseconds between writing the
     *    reply and the rewritten `cat` reading it. A pathologically stopped
     *    tracee (SIGSTOP between execve-enter and the read) is the sole way to
     *    exceed it, and that already means the caller is not reading its output.
     *
     * Failures are logged and swallowed: a leaked temp file must never break an
