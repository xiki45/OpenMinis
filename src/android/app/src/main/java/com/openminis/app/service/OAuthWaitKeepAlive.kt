 * it with the service and the log.
 *
 * One entry per flow rather than a bare counter, so a flow ending twice (its
 * own stop() after a callback, then the caller's cleanup stop()) releases once,
 * and one flow ending never releases another's protection. Every entry carries
 * a deadline: a flow that never reaches stop() (the user closed the tab and
 * stayed on the screen, or the browser launch threw after the server started)
 * must not keep the service alive for ever.

/**
 * [T-oauth-wait-fgs] Keeps Minis from being frozen while a sign-in waits for its
 * localhost redirect.
 *
 * Field log (HUAWEI tablet, Android 12): the Custom Tab opened at 15:19:36.160,
 * the whole process stopped a second later, and the redirect was served at
 * 15:20:16.278 - in the same millisecond the process thawed. With the browser
 * on top, Minis is a cached background process and the cached-apps freezer
 * stops it; the kernel still accepts the browser's connection to
 * localhost:1455, but the thread that would answer it is frozen, so the page
 * spins (~17 s for OpenAI in the user's video, who then gave up).
 *
 * [OAuthCallbackServer] calls [begin] when it starts listening - right before
 * the browser opens, from the user's tap, so the app is in the foreground - and
 * [end] on every way it stops. While at least one flow is active,
 * [OAuthWaitService] (a `dataSync` foreground service) holds the process at a
 * perceptible priority, out of the freezer's reach. Every provider (Claude
 * 54545, OpenAI 1455, xAI 56121, OpenRouter 3000) and MCP OAuth share the
 * server, so all get it without their own wiring.
