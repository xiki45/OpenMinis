/**
 * [T-android-live-update-content] Pure content model for the ongoing agent
 * notification / Android 16 Live Update chip. Everything here is a function
 * of tracker state so it can be unit-tested without a Service or a device,
 * and so the notification and the floating overlay resolve the same
 * phase from the same inputs.
 *
 * The phases mirror what the iOS Dynamic Island and the Android overlay
 * capsule already distinguish:
 *  - [COMPLETED]  the run finished and the notification is resting
 *  - [TOOL]       a tool call is executing (icon/title identify the tool)
 *  - [THINKING]   the model is emitting reasoning, no visible text yet
 *  - [GENERATING] the model is streaming the visible reply
 *  - [IDLE]       service alive with nothing running (presence only)
 *  - [WAITING]    nothing running, a chat waits for its next scheduled run
 *                 ([T-port-sched-wait-notification], iOS fa7adaf9e's waiting
 *                 card): counts down to the run and KEEPS Stop, which is the
 *                 only way to turn the schedule off from the notification
 *  - [ASKING]     a user_ask question waits for the user ([T-android-user-ask-chip]):
 *                 its own icon and text, the clock counting down to the
 *                 question's timeout, so a backgrounded user sees it needs them
 *                 instead of a "Running" that never ends
