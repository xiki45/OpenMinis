/**
 * Main-thread hang watchdog.
 *
 * Posts a heartbeat task to the main looper at a fixed cadence and waits on a
 * background thread for it to fire. If the heartbeat fails to land within
 * [HANG_THRESHOLD_MS], the main thread is considered hung — capture its stack
 * trace, append a record to a daily `stall-<date>.log` file under the app's
 * logs/ dir, increment a persisted hang counter, and continue.
 *
 * After [HANG_LIMIT_FOR_BREAKER] hangs accumulate the [shouldForceHomeOnLaunch]
 * gate flips true. AppNavigation reads it on cold start and overrides the
 * user's "open last session" / "open new chat" launch preference to "open
 * home" (mode 3) so the user isn't trapped in a loop where every cold start
 * lands on a session that hangs the UI again.
 *
 * The counter resets when the user successfully runs a chat session for
 * [RESET_AFTER_QUIET_MS] without another hang firing — see [markHealthyTick].
 *
 * [T-android-hang-false-positive] Gaps are measured on the MONOTONIC uptime
 * clock, the same clock the heartbeat's postDelayed runs on. The wall clock
 * used before kept running through deep sleep and jumped on time sync, so a
 * phone waking up (09-25: "41509s") or correcting its clock after boot
 * (09-28: "16521299s", main thread idle in nativePollOnce) was recorded and
 * COUNTED as a hang. Two more guards keep a false positive out of the count:
 * a main thread found idle at trip time, and a gap no real hang can reach.
 *
 * No iOS counterpart yet (intentional — iOS only has the DEBUG-mode RPC hang
 * detector at src/ios/Debug/DebugRPCHangDetector.swift; this is a production
 * circuit breaker).
