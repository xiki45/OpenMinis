/**
 * [T-native-offload-bind] The `/usr/local/bin/<handler>` stub every offload CLI
 * resolves to on PATH.
 *
 * On the normal path the stub never runs: proot's native_offload extension
 * intercepts the execve and serves the command from the app. It runs only
 * when that did not happen - the app could not bind its offload socket (the
 * launcher then leaves `--native-offload` off), or the offload call failed.
 * It used to be `exit 0`, so a broken offload looked like a successful
 * command with no output; now it says what is wrong and exits non-zero.
