/**
 * [GH #453] Process resource water marks: thread count, memory-mapping count,
 * open fds, VmSize / VmRSS, and, past a threshold, how many threads share each
 * name.
 *
 * Why: a 1.15-beta.4 field report died after hours (once after 13.6 h in the
 * background) with `pthread_create (1040KB stack) failed: Try again` and
 * `Scudo ERROR: internal map failure` alternating - a process running out of
 * threads or of memory mappings (the kernel's vm.max_map_count, 65530 by
 * default; every thread costs a stack mapping plus a guard). Nothing in the
 * logs said which, or who was creating them. JankDiag's 30 s heartbeat already
 * printed `threads=`, but only while an Activity was resumed, so a process that
 * grew in the background printed nothing.
 *
 * Everything here is plain file reads on whatever thread calls it (JankDiag's
 * background HandlerThread). Nothing is held between calls except the
 * reporting gate's two numbers, nothing allocates per mapping, and every read
 * swallows its own failure and reports -1: a diagnostic must keep working in a
 * process that is already failing to allocate, and must never be the thing
 * that throws.
